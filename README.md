# Boids

Fairly simple and straitforward boids simulation in EcmaScript.

## What?

Boids (short for bird-like objects) are simulated version of birds. They act according to 3 simple rules (**separation**, **alignment** and **cohesion**) and they soon organize in natural-looking flocks. This kind of *artificial life* is often used in computer graphics and movies to emulate flocks and migrations of birds and other animals.

This is my personal implementation, made by scratch by following the description on wikipedia.

## Instructions

- `CLICK` (or `TAP`) anywhere on the canvas to attract boids
- Use the on screen inputs to influence the boids. The `gravity` scale influences the force applied to each boid when the mouse is pressed.
