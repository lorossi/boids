# Boids

Fairly simple and straitforward boids simulation in EcmaScript.

## What?

Boids (short for bird-like objects) are simulated version of birds. They act according to 3 simple rules (**separation**, **alignment** and **cohesion**) and they soon organize in natural-looking flocks. This kind of *artificial life* is often used in computer graphics and movies to emulate flocks and migrations of birds and other animals.

I find this really fascinating. By setting a few extremely simple rules, even a cold frigid PC can emulate something... almost alive. Almost.

This is my personal implementation, made by scratch by following the description on wikipedia.

## Instructions

- `CLICK` (or `TAP`) anywhere on the canvas to attract boids
- Use the on screen inputs to influence the boids. The `gravity` scale influences the force applied to each boid when the mouse is pressed.
